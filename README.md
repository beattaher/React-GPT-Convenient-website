After experiencing a lawsuit, I deeply felt the difficulty for ordinary people to safeguard their rights. Lawyers are expensive and unaffordable, legal education is lacking, and the Chinese government only publishes obscure and difficult-to-understand legal provisions. Various answers can be found online, but specific information is hard to come by.

Therefore, I created this GPT-based website. Of course, as a novice, there are still many imperfect areas, but it is generally usable (please let me know if there are any bugs). Moreover, I added an audio upload function to allow GPT to obtain speech information. (I originally wanted to add a document upload function, but I was lazy and will rest for a while first).

The most unexpected thing is the "Note Assistant" that I built on the side. 

1. If a foreign student cannot understand a lecture in a foreign country, it can provide translations in all languages (including Cantonese) and summarize the content (p1 is an audio of Obama's inauguration speech).

2. If a boss talks too much nonsense, it can remove the nonsense with one click (I tried "Waste Literature" which is a highly ranked video website, and it seems that GPT has done its best).

P3, p4, and p5 are the Chinese legal service website and the comparison chart of "Legal Assistant" in New York and Chongqing, consulting the same issues. The effect is okay? I feel that it is okay, but if I have money, I can build a database to train GPT myself, and the effect should be much better.

If the database is in place, it can even help you defend in court. The website can switch between three models, and GPT4 is still the strongest. If you are interested in the development of GPT-related applications, you can refer to my code, which I have uploaded to Github. If you can give it a star, I would be very grateful.

At present, OpenAI has not publicly released too many functions, and even image recognition is not yet available. I look forward to more new features.
