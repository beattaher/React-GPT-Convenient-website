Since I haven't developed a back-end yet and openAI has strict API management rules, I cannot publicly share my API. As soon as it becomes public, my API will be blocked. I apologize for the inconvenience. However, you can privately ask me for one. It would be better to purchase one yourself; otherwise, it's easy to get blocked. I believe GPT will trigger a new industrial revolution, further reducing authority and improving productivity. This is an exciting moment! I hope I can contribute to this and help more people.",
