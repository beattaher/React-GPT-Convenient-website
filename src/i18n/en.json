After binding a credit card to your OpenAI account on the official website, you will have a certain amount of free usage each month. To obtain an OpenAI Key, visit https://beta.openai.com/signup and create an account. You can find the key in the API Keys section of your OpenAI Dashboard. But if you really don't have one, just ask me for one. After I finish the backend of this website, I'll make sure the site comes with a key.",

Since I haven't developed a back-end yet and openAI has strict API management rules, I cannot publicly share my API. As soon as it becomes public, my API will be blocked. I apologize for the inconvenience. However, you can privately ask me for one. It would be better to purchase one yourself; otherwise, it's easy to get blocked. I believe GPT will trigger a new industrial revolution, further reducing authority and improving productivity. This is an exciting moment! I hope I can contribute to this and help more people.",
